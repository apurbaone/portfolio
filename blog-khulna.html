          Khulna City, located in the southwestern region of Bangladesh, is a place of rich culture and history. During my visit, I was captivated by the serene beauty of the Rupsha River and the vibrant local markets. The city is also the gateway to the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world.

          Walking through the streets of Khulna, I experienced the warmth of its people and the delicious local cuisine. The traditional "Pithas" and fresh seafood were a treat to my taste buds. This visit left me with unforgettable memories and a deep appreciation for the city's charm.
